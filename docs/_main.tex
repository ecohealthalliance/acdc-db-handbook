\chapter{About}\label{about}}

This is a handbook created as a how-to manual for the development and maintenance of a One Health Research Information Gateway for the African continent.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\href{https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/}{EcoHelth Alliance} is supporting the creation of a database of active infectious disease research activities and research scientists in Africa. The database contains information about scientific research being conducted on the African continent that has particular relevance to understanding, detecting and responding to zoonotic pathogens. EHA is building a detailed, searchable, and visual database (e.g.~via a dashboard) populated with information about major (e.g.~multi-year) and active One Health research projects that includes subject matter, duration, geographical locations, key personnel, and links to publicly available reports, preprints and publications relevant to zoonoses. Examples of research areas may include epidemiological (syndrome based or disease specific), ecological (studies looking at potential reservoirs or animal hosts for zoonotic pathogens and spillover into humans or livestock); basic science (e.g.~virology, bacteriology; serology); clinical (vaccine or therapeutic trials); or sociological (e.g.~behavioral risk assessments or behavioral intervention studies) or any other preliminary public health findings. A particularly important view within the database includes a directory of subject matter experts associated with research across the continent. This roster view can be used by public health practitioners to engage expert consultations as needed to support training activities, surveillance or outbreak response, for example.

\hypertarget{tools}{%

The Research Information Gateway (RIG) is currently using the following set of tools for database development and maintenance.

\hypertarget{airtable}{%
\section{Airtable}\label{airtable}}

\hypertarget{what-is-airtable}{%
\subsection{What is Airtable?}\label{what-is-airtable}}

\href{https://airtable.com}{Airtable} is a cloud-based software platform that allows users to create and manage databases, spreadsheets, and other types of organizational tools. It can be used for a variety of purposes, including project management, customer relationship management, inventory tracking, event planning, and much more.

One of the key features of Airtable is its flexible and customizable nature. Users can create and customize their own database structures, and can choose from a wide range of data types, including text, attachments, checkboxes, and more. This allows for a high degree of customization and adaptability to different use cases and workflows.

Airtable also offers a variety of collaboration features, including real-time syncing and commenting, as well as integrations with other popular tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Trello. Additionally, Airtable has a robust API that allows developers to build custom integrations and applications on top of the platform.

Airtable's flexibility, customizability, and features that support collaboration along with its spreadsheet-style interface that is familiar to most that have used other spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets are the key reasons why it was chosen to be the database tool for RIG.

This \protect\hyperlink{airtable}{section} will provide an overview of Airtable and good practices for designing data models in relational databases.

\hypertarget{key-terms}{%
\subsection{Key Terms}\label{key-terms}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Workspace} - A collection of bases
\item
  \textbf{Base} - A database. Each is identified by the Airtable API via a \texttt{base\ id}
\item
  \textbf{Table} - A tabular data set within a base. Each table is identified by the Airtable API via the name of the table e.g.~``Demo Table''
\item
  \textbf{Record} - An individual cell within a table. Each record is identified by the Airtable API via a \texttt{record\ id}
\item
  \textbf{Field} - A property of data in a table
\item
  \textbf{Views} - A specific way of displaying a table. Default is grid.
\item
  \textbf{Entity} - Something that either physically or logically exists whose properties are typically stored in a table and composed of data elements.
\item
  \textbf{Element} - an attribute of a Entity (a field)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{security-and-access-control}{%
\subsection{Security and Access Control}\label{security-and-access-control}}

Airtable maintains physical and technological security as part of its ISO IEC 27001:2013 and SOC 2 compliance measures. Data are 256-bit encrypted when storing on the server and also when transferring data over the internet. To find vulnerabilities in their software, they run daily, weekly, and monthly scans on different components of their system and regularly commission external penetration tests. They also run a bug bounty program to help identify issues. Their data centers have fire detection and suppression systems, redundant power systems, and strict control for physical access. Because Airtable relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for its cloud infrastructure (the same providers used by previous EHA projects), data are geo-redundantly replicated in backups across multiple zones to increase data durability. They also have a team monitoring services at all times. Airtable employees are thoroughly vetted before hiring and continually trained on data protection best practices. Their workstations are secured by using full-disk encryption, automatic locking, and strong password requirements.

\hypertarget{user--and-administrator-security-features}{%
\subsubsection{User- and Administrator Security Features}\label{user--and-administrator-security-features}}

\hypertarget{access-controls}{%
\paragraph{Access Controls}\label{access-controls}}

Airtable provides database (referred to as ``base'') and workspace administrators with granular controls over who can view, edit, comment, or otherwise modify data at the base, table, and field levels. There are four levels of Airtable user permissions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Owner/Creator}: Full administrative control of base\\
\item
  \textbf{Editor}: Sees full base, create and modify records and views, create and modify view share links\\
\item
  \textbf{Commenter}: Sees full base, comment on records\\
\item
  \textbf{Reader}: Sees full base
\end{itemize}

Direct access to a base or workspace is granted or removed by base owners and creators to Airtable users. Base owners and creators can control who has access to a base and can control any ``share'' links created for that base. They may also restrict editing of tables or fields within a base. Any collaborator given direct access to a base at any permission level will be able to duplicate that base and share that data further. It is important that direct access to the base is limited to individuals with a need to curate or analyze the data.

\hypertarget{share-links-and-interfaces}{%
\paragraph{Share Links and Interfaces}\label{share-links-and-interfaces}}

To further restrict access to a base, users can be given indirect access via revocable share links or interfaces.

\href{https://support.airtable.com/docs/creating-a-base-share-link-or-a-view-share-link}{Share links} can be customized to prevent users from seeing the full base, prevent duplicating the base, and prevent copying data from the base. The ability to use the link can be password protected, restricted to people with certain email domains, and may be revoked at any time. If there are concerns about data leaks via base or table duplication, inviting people with a need to view the data via share links constrains their ability to extract data from the base.

\href{https://support.airtable.com/docs/interface-designer-overview}{Interfaces} are dynamic dashboards built on a limited set of data in an airtable base. Users can explore or even edit data based on the permissions provided by the interface creator. Access can be further tuned by setting up a ``current-user filter''. See \href{https://support.airtable.com/docs/interface-designer-permissions}{this guide} for more information.

\hypertarget{data-in-airtable}{%
\subsection{Data in Airtable}\label{data-in-airtable}}

See \href{https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010928147-Airtable-plans}{Airtable plan comparison} for more information on the size of bases and features available. Information in this section pertains to all plans unless specified.

\hypertarget{workspaces-bases-tables-fields-records}{%
\subsubsection{Workspaces, Bases, Tables, Fields, Records}\label{workspaces-bases-tables-fields-records}}

Airtable uses workspaces, bases, tables, and fields to manage data. A workspace generally pertains to a particular project and contains all bases relevant to that project. Sharing a workspace with someone allows them to see all bases within that workspace.

Bases are equivalent to databases. They consist of a set of tables that can be linked and allow you to perform some task (e.g.~IRB tracking, capturing research data, etc.). Bases can be duplicated and shared across your workspaces and you can share bases with other users.

Tables are where most of the action happens. Data is entered in tables, tables can be transformed via views into calendars, dashboards, or galleries, and tables can be manipulated via the API. They describe a data entity and are composed of fields. In the bat sampling example, each circle would be a table in the bat sampling base.

Fields represent properties of a data entity. In a spreadsheet view, fields are columns. Airtable allows you to control field types (date, number, text, file attachments, logical, etc.) and paid plans allows you to control who can edit fields. Fields can be linked between tables creating links.

Records are the individual data points in a table. In a spreadsheet they would be the rows. Records are shaped by the structure you have created in tables and fields. Each record has a URL that can be used to access it programatically or share it.

\hypertarget{views}{%
\subsection{Views}\label{views}}

In Airtable, tables can be displayed in different views to emphasis different components of the data. Views are great for creating concise presentations of data, especially in sprawling tables. The default view in an table is the grid (spreadsheet) view. All other views will derive from the data entered in this view.

For more on views, see \href{https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/202624989-Guide-to-views}{the guide to views}.

\hypertarget{internal-backups-record-history-base-snapshots}{%
\subsection{Internal Backups: Record History, Base Snapshots}\label{internal-backups-record-history-base-snapshots}}

Airtable has system for tracking changes to a base. They provide revision history for individual records (how long those histories are stored varies by plan). Any comments made in the revision history will be stored for the life of the record (on any plan). The current state of an entire base may be captured through snapshots. Should a systemic issue arise, the base can be restored to a snapshot at a later date. Restoring from a snapshot will remove the revision history for a record but comments on that record will be maintained.

As revision histories are maintained, ``deleted'' records may be retrieved. In the event of the need to permanently remove data, the revision history of the base may be removed.

Airtable allows data to be exported as CSVs from individual tables. At this time there is not an Airtable supported base export function.

\hypertarget{importing-data}{%
\subsection{Importing data}\label{importing-data}}

Data can be imported to Airtable from a number of sources including CSV files, excel, Google sheets, XML, and via copy paste. Airtable will guess what the most appropriate field type is, so make sure the field type is appropriate for the data (e.g.~convert from text to date type fields). Certain sources, like Google sheets, can be imported as bases.

For more on importing data see: \href{https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/sections/200928025-Importing-and-adding-data}{Importing and Adding data}

\hypertarget{base-design}{%
\section{Base Design}\label{base-design}}

Having a good base design will make using your data easier. Generally, the process looks like this:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe what the database will do and collect use cases
\item
  Determine the roles of various stakeholders
\item
  List out the entities in the database and define their properties
\item
  Map out how the entities fit together (which properties link them)
\item
  Check that the mapping meets the use cases
\item
  Build base in Airtable
\item
  Check that the base meets the use cases
\end{enumerate}

If you are migrating from spreadsheets, you likely already have an idea of what you need the base to do and a collection of data properties. It is still a good idea to follow the steps outlined above for mapping out entities. You may find that entire sheets can be replaced by views or that the data in one sheet should actually be stored in two different tables.

Feel free to reach out to the data librarian for questions about base design.

\hypertarget{automating-airtable}{%
\section{Automating Airtable}\label{automating-airtable}}

Airtable has five main routes for automating processes.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050974153-Automations-overview}{Automations} - a drag and drop visual programming tool
\item
  \href{https://support.airtable.com/docs/airtable-extensions-overview}{Extensions} - pre-built applications that perform some task
\item
  \href{https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043041074-Scripting-app-overview}{Scripting} - use JavaScript to automate tasks within Airtable
\item
  \href{https://www.airtable.com/developers/apps/guides/getting-started}{Blocks} - use JavaScript to create custom applications
\item
  \href{https://airtable.com/api}{REST API} - use whatever programming language you like to automate processes
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{automations-with-drag-and-drop-programing-pro-and-above}{%
\subsection{Automations with Drag and Drop Programing (pro and above)}\label{automations-with-drag-and-drop-programing-pro-and-above}}

The automations feature within Airtable allows you to visually program routines. Each automation has three basic components:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Status - controls whether or not the automation will run when the trigger condition is met
\item
  Triggers - condition for automation to run: the creation or change of a record, a scheduled time, or some other external action
\item
  Actions - what the automation will do
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{_main_files/figure-latex/actions diagram-1.pdf}

Automations are commonly used to augment the synced tables feature, send notifications, check data quality, and manipulate or create records.

This automation creates a weekly summary of applicants who applied for a position. Its trigger is time based, then it finds records that match a condition, and finally it generates an email from those records and sends to the appropriate recipients.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{./images/airtable_Weekly Digest.png}
\caption{airtable weekly summary}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{scripting-and-blocks-pro-plan-and-above}{%
\subsection{Scripting and Blocks (pro plan and above)}\label{scripting-and-blocks-pro-plan-and-above}}

Scripting uses JavaScript to manipulate a base from within an application in Airtable. Scripting is flexible but has a steep learning curve. The scripting environment Airtable provides can be helpful as it provides code \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)}{linting}, direct access to documentation, and example scripts to build from. The major drawback to scripting is that scripts live in the base and files are not version controlled.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are a LOT of \href{https://airtable.com/marketplace/category/scripts}{pre-written scripts, in a shared ``marketplace''} to perform automatic actions. Search the marketplace before you start writing bespoke code.
\end{itemize}

Blocks are custom applications built in JavaScript and node.js that add to base functionality. They are created in a development environment outside of Airtable then brought back into platform. There are number of \href{https://www.airtable.com/developers/apps/guides/getting-started}{tutorials for getting started with blocks}.

\hypertarget{using-the-rest-api}{%
\section{Using the REST API}\label{using-the-rest-api}}

All Airtable bases are automatically accessible to authorized users via a REST API. The list of API accessible bases you have access to can be found here: \url{https://airtable.com/api}. By clicking on a base you will be able to see the full API documentation for that base.

\hypertarget{scoped-tokens}{%
\subsection{Scoped Tokens}\label{scoped-tokens}}

Airtable is moving to a \href{https://airtable.com/developers/web/guides/personal-access-tokens}{scoped tokens} based approach to api access. Scoped personal access tokens allow you to create a token for a specific base with specific permissions - e.g.~token has read-only access to a bat sampling base. Using scoped tokens in this way means that if the token is compromised (leaked, stolen, accidentally committed unencrypted to a github repo, etc), you can delete that token to remove any access it might have had and the limited scope means that you know exactly what a person would have been able to access.

To create a personal access token go here: \url{https://airtable.com/create/tokens}

** Remember to save the token in a secure place. Do not store unencrypted tokens on the web (e.g.~pushing them to github).

Airtable has also deployed \href{https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/oauth-reference}{oauth tokens} for all users.

\hypertarget{airtable-and-r}{%
\subsection{Airtable and R}\label{airtable-and-r}}

The Airtable REST API can be used via R with the \href{https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/airtabler}{airtabler package}. EHA has started a fork of the package that has additional functionality so it is recommended to use that version. The original package design works well for exploring the data. Our extension adds additional functionality to help use \texttt{airtabler} in automation via continuous integration such as GitHub Actions.

\begin{verbatim}
devtools::install_github("ecohealthalliance/airtabler")
\end{verbatim}

The Airtable API serves up data as JSON, which has a hierarchical structure similar to a list in R. To handle JSON, \texttt{airtabler} uses the \texttt{jsonlite} package. Its helpful to understand how \texttt{jsonlite} handles different JSON structures when working with more complicated Airtable data. See the \texttt{jsonlite} \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html}{quick-start guide} for a basic overview. The \href{https://purrr.tidyverse.org/}{\texttt{purr} package} is extremely helpful when dealing with data objects derived from JSON because it facilitates navigating nested data structures.

The \texttt{airtabler} package provides instructions for setting up access to the Airtable API. You will need to follow those instructions for the following examples to work.

\textbf{One to One join}

\begin{verbatim}
library(airtabler)

table1  <-  fetch_all(base = "app49bbyLczZxX9PM",table_name = "One To One")

table2 <- fetch_all(base = "app49bbyLczZxX9PM",table_name = "Table 2")

## Linked records are stored as JSON arrays so they become lists 
## when part of a data frame. Because each array has a length of 1
## we can safely unlist the arrays and add them back as to the 
## data frame.

table1$LinkedRec <- unlist(table1$LinkedRec)

joinedTables <- dplyr::left_join(table1,table2, by = c("LinkedRec"="id"))

recordKey <- joinedTables[c("Name","LinkedRec","Number")]

recordKey

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{One to Many Join}

\begin{verbatim}
library(airtabler)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)

oneToMany  <-  fetch_all(base = "app49bbyLczZxX9PM",table_name = "One To Many")

table2 <- fetch_all(base = "app49bbyLczZxX9PM",table_name = "Table 2")

# Depending on how you want to work with the data joins are a 
# little trickier here. 

## to replace the values but keep the structure

oneToMany$LinkedRecReplace <- purrr::map(oneToMany$LinkedRec, function(x){
  table2 %>%
    filter(id %in% x) %>%
    select(c("id","Number")) %>% 
    pull("Number")
})

data.frame(
  id = unlist(oneToMany$LinkedRec), 
  label = unlist(oneToMany$LinkedRecReplace)
)
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{data-management}{%
\section{Data Management}\label{data-management}}

Because of its flexibility and ease of use, it is extremely important that data
management for airtable be taken seriously. Unlike most other relational databases,
the fundamental properties of your base can be changed easily by multiple users
without warning! Documenting the structure and purpose of your base, as well
as creating regular external backups could save you from catastrophe.

\hypertarget{metadata}{%
\subsection{Metadata}\label{metadata}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Structural metadata} - Information about a resource that tells you how its
  put together - e.g.~the relationship between a table, field, and automation. With
  the exception of users on the enterprise plan, you must be deliberate about
  creating and maintaining structural metadata for your base.
\end{itemize}

Example of Airtable Structural Metadata:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Descriptive metadata} - Information about a resource that makes it easier to
  find and attribute data. This includes things attributes like author, title, description,
  keywords, etc. This table becomes especially important when data are transitioned
  out of airtable, at the end of a project, or if the base will be shared broadly
  with collaborators.
\end{itemize}

Example of Airtable Descriptive Metadata:

To see the template base, follow this \href{https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv5ycCAbIVw1WM3Z\&inviteToken=ef7b72e998a0a69d835244f87f88b6b9b6b1094915239ebc93423e1257fcd72b\&utm_medium=email\&utm_source=product_team\&utm_content=transactional-alerts}{link}

\hypertarget{metadata-for-automations-and-extensions}{%
\subsubsection{Metadata for automations and extensions}\label{metadata-for-automations-and-extensions}}

Automations and extensions live entirely inside airtable. As of August 2022, Airtable introduced a ``Manage Fields'' tab that provides metadata for a specific table, including any automation dependencies. It is not possible to export those dependency tables or the code used in automations automatically. This makes it extremely important to document any automations and extensions outside your base.

\hypertarget{external-backups}{%
\subsection{External Backups}\label{external-backups}}

It is a good idea to create regular external backups of airtable data in the event
that something catastrophic happens to your base or you simply decide you no longer wish
to use airtable as your data store.Unfortunately, airtable does not provide an
off the shelf solution for this. Below are three options for extracting all data
from your base.

\hypertarget{r}{%
\section{R}\label{r}}

\href{https://cran.r-project.org}{R} is a free and open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It was first developed in the early 1990s by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is now widely used by statisticians, data analysts, and researchers across various fields.

R provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and more. It also has a large and active community of users and developers who contribute to the development of new packages and extensions for the language.

R is popular in the field of data science, as it provides a powerful and flexible platform for analyzing and visualizing data. It can be used in conjuction with other tools such as Airtable through community-developed packages making it particularly well-suited for the current use-case of the RIG.

Following is an initial list of sources of information used for the RIG database.

The initial search performed was non-systematic and focused primarily on a known funder of global research related/relevant to the topics of interest for the database . The main aim of focusing first on this limited and focused search was to get a sense of what information is available from such bodies/organisations, and the limitations of the information available. This is based on an initial idea that research funders would tend to have a system of collecting/archiving information on research they have funded. The expectation was that at the minimum, the information available from funders would lead to identifying further sources of information relevant to the ACDC database specifically those of research groups/institutions particularly those based in countries/regions within Africa. This initial search will hopefully inform a more systematic and informed search strategy for the database information.

\hypertarget{ukri}{%

\hypertarget{clinicaltrials.gov}{%
\section{ClinicalTrials.gov}\label{clinicaltrials.gov}}

ClinicalTrials.gov is a publicly accessible database of clinical trials that are being conducted worldwide. It is maintained by the National Library of Medicine, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States.

The database provides information on clinical trials for a wide range of diseases and conditions, including both interventional and observational studies. It includes information about the purpose of the trial, who may participate, where the trial is being conducted, and the status of the trial, such as whether it is recruiting participants or has been completed.

ClinicalTrials.gov was created in response to a 1997 law requiring the registration of clinical trials for certain serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. Since then, the database has grown to include information on thousands of trials from around the world.

ClinicalTrials.gov is an important resource for researchers, healthcare professionals, and members of the public who are interested in clinical research. It can be used to identify ongoing or completed trials, learn about the purpose and design of a study, and find out how to participate in a trial. It also serves as a platform for researchers to share their results and comply with the requirements of various funding agencies and regulatory bodies.

Using the downloadable spreadsheet of funds awarded between 01st of October 2005 and 4th of May 2022 found at \url{https://cms.wellcome.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/Wellcome-grants-awarded-1-October-2005-to-04-05-2022.xlsx}, the following steps were taken to retrieve relevant information for the database:

\hypertarget{how-to-update}{%
\subsection{How to update}\label{how-to-update}}

Please note that the steps below were done using the current available spreadsheet from the Wellcome Trust website and added the relevant projects to the RIG database. These steps can therefore be used as a guide for how to update the database with new information in the future to when the Wellcome Trust publishes its most up-to-date spreadsheet.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Go to column J -- Recipient Org:Country -\textgreater{} deselect all and then select all the African countries in the list
\item
  Go to column N -- Planned end date -\textgreater{} select all the years in the future
\item
  These two steps reduced the list from 19,833 projects to 111 projects
\item
  Read the project title and decide if the project is relevant for our database or not
\item
  If unsure, read the abstract -- that also helps to identify the keywords to tag the project within our database
\item
  If the project is relevant transfer all the information into our database
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} This method is only able to detect projects/activities where an African organisation itself holds the grant. It does not detect projects where African researchers are involved as collaborators. The spreadsheet does not list collaborators on projects, so it's yet to be determined how we will identify projects on which African research institutes collaborate with international organisations being awarded the grant.

In order to aid in automation, maintain a list relevant search terms for each topic of interest (stored in the ``Topics'' table in Airtable). Even if the terms are not used for the purposes of developing a search strategy, they can be used by those who are not subject matter experts when collection information on a specific topic

\end{verbatim}

The majority of results from this search, when conducted in \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/}{PubMed}, appeared relevant to the database (based on title/abstract scanning)

This search yielded a large quantity of results, not all of which were relevant. Manual processes are required to validate results.

Including terms to filter the results based on location were helpful, but still included results not located on the African continent. Search term to filter for African countries:

\begin{verbatim}

Validation of results can be useful to better understand the overlap between publications and activities and determine the priority of searching through publications vs.~navigating to institution sites directly (or other strategies).

After finding a relevant publication, look at the publication's authors and their respective institutions

Navigate to institutions' sites to search for publications or results from research

Are their activities listed on the site? Are those activities explicitly mentioned in the publications? Etc.

The European \& Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) is a non-profit organisation with a European office in The Hague, The Netherlands and an African office in Cape Town, South Africa. EDCTP is a partnership between European Union (EU), Norway, Switzerland, and African countries to accelerate the development of new clinical interventions such as drugs, vaccines, microbicides, and diagnostics against poverty-related diseases in Africa. The organisation supports clinical trials, capacity strengthening and networking in Africa and Europe. Funding comes from the EU, member states, pharmaceutical industry and private organisations and charities like The Wellcome Trust and The Bill \& Melinda Gates foundation.

\textbf{Note:} Since funding comes from several sources that we also list as sources for populating the database such as the European Union (European Commission), The Wellcome Trust and The Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation, there is the possibility that downloading project information from all these sources into our database could lead to duplicate entries. I created a column in the Actvities table for the Project ID, as this might be helpful to identify duplicates and remove them automatically.
