"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction EcoHelth Alliance is supporting the creation of a database of active infectious disease research activities and research scientists in Africa. The database contains information about scientific research being conducted on the African continent that has particular relevance to understanding, detecting and responding to zoonotic pathogens. EHA is building a detailed, searchable, and visual database (e.g. via a dashboard) populated with information about major (e.g. multi-year) and active One Health research projects that includes subject matter, duration, geographical locations, key personnel, and links to publicly available reports, preprints and publications relevant to zoonoses. Examples of research areas may include epidemiological (syndrome based or disease specific), ecological (studies looking at potential reservoirs or animal hosts for zoonotic pathogens and spillover into humans or livestock); basic science (e.g. virology, bacteriology; serology); clinical (vaccine or therapeutic trials); or sociological (e.g. behavioral risk assessments or behavioral intervention studies) or any other preliminary public health findings. A particularly important view within the database includes a directory of subject matter experts associated with research across the continent. This roster view can be used by public health practitioners to engage expert consultations as needed to support training activities, surveillance or outbreak response, for example.

Airtable is a cloud-based software platform that allows users to create and manage databases, spreadsheets, and other types of organizational tools. It can be used for a variety of purposes, including project management, customer relationship management, inventory tracking, event planning, and much more. One of the key features of Airtable is its flexible and customizable nature. Users can create and customize their own database structures, and can choose from a wide range of data types, including text, attachments, checkboxes, and more. This allows for a high degree of customization and adaptability to different use cases and workflows. Airtable also offers a variety of collaboration features, including real-time syncing and commenting, as well as integrations with other popular tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Trello. Additionally, Airtable has a robust API that allows developers to build custom integrations and applications on top of the platform. Airtable’s flexibility, customizability, and features that support collaboration along with its spreadsheet-style interface that is familiar to most that have used other spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets are the key reasons why it was chosen to be the database tool for RIG. This section will provide an overview of Airtable and good practices for designing data models in relational databases. 3.1.2 Key Terms Workspace - A collection of bases Base - A database. Each is identified by the Airtable API via a base id Table - A tabular data set within a base. Each table is identified by the Airtable API via the name of the table e.g. “Demo Table” Record - An individual cell within a table. Each record is identified by the Airtable API via a record id Field - A property of data in a table Views - A specific way of displaying a table. Default is grid. Entity - Something that either physically or logically exists whose properties are typically stored in a table and composed of data elements. Element - an attribute of a Entity (a field) 3.1.3 Security and Access Control Airtable maintains physical and technological security as part of its ISO IEC 27001:2013 and SOC 2 compliance measures. Data are 256-bit encrypted when storing on the server and also when transferring data over the internet. To find vulnerabilities in their software, they run daily, weekly, and monthly scans on different components of their system and regularly commission external penetration tests. They also run a bug bounty program to help identify issues. Their data centers have fire detection and suppression systems, redundant power systems, and strict control for physical access. Because Airtable relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for its cloud infrastructure (the same providers used by previous EHA projects), data are geo-redundantly replicated in backups across multiple zones to increase data durability. They also have a team monitoring services at all times. Airtable employees are thoroughly vetted before hiring and continually trained on data protection best practices. Their workstations are secured by using full-disk encryption, automatic locking, and strong password requirements. 3.1.3.1 User- and Administrator Security Features 3.1.3.1.1 Access Controls Airtable provides database (referred to as “base”) and workspace administrators with granular controls over who can view, edit, comment, or otherwise modify data at the base, table, and field levels. There are four levels of Airtable user permissions: Owner/Creator: Full administrative control of base Editor: Sees full base, create and modify records and views, create and modify view share links Commenter: Sees full base, comment on records Reader: Sees full base Direct access to a base or workspace is granted or removed by base owners and creators to Airtable users. Base owners and creators can control who has access to a base and can control any “share” links created for that base. They may also restrict editing of tables or fields within a base. Any collaborator given direct access to a base at any permission level will be able to duplicate that base and share that data further. It is important that direct access to the base is limited to individuals with a need to curate or analyze the data. 3.1.3.1.2 Share Links and Interfaces To further restrict access to a base, users can be given indirect access via revocable share links or interfaces. Share links can be customized to prevent users from seeing the full base, prevent duplicating the base, and prevent copying data from the base. The ability to use the link can be password protected, restricted to people with certain email domains, and may be revoked at any time. If there are concerns about data leaks via base or table duplication, inviting people with a need to view the data via share links constrains their ability to extract data from the base. Interfaces are dynamic dashboards built on a limited set of data in an airtable base. Users can explore or even edit data based on the permissions provided by the interface creator. Access can be further tuned by setting up a “current-user filter”. See this guide for more information. 3.1.4 Data in Airtable See Airtable plan comparison for more information on the size of bases and features available. Information in this section pertains to all plans unless specified. 3.1.4.1 Workspaces, Bases, Tables, Fields, Records Airtable uses workspaces, bases, tables, and fields to manage data. A workspace generally pertains to a particular project and contains all bases relevant to that project. Sharing a workspace with someone allows them to see all bases within that workspace. Bases are equivalent to databases. They consist of a set of tables that can be linked and allow you to perform some task (e.g. IRB tracking, capturing research data, etc.). Bases can be duplicated and shared across your workspaces and you can share bases with other users. Tables are where most of the action happens. Data is entered in tables, tables can be transformed via views into calendars, dashboards, or galleries, and tables can be manipulated via the API. They describe a data entity and are composed of fields. In the bat sampling example, each circle would be a table in the bat sampling base. Fields represent properties of a data entity. In a spreadsheet view, fields are columns. Airtable allows you to control field types (date, number, text, file attachments, logical, etc.) and paid plans allows you to control who can edit fields. Fields can be linked between tables creating links. Records are the individual data points in a table. In a spreadsheet they would be the rows. Records are shaped by the structure you have created in tables and fields. Each record has a URL that can be used to access it programatically or share it. 3.1.5 Views In Airtable, tables can be displayed in different views to emphasis different components of the data. Views are great for creating concise presentations of data, especially in sprawling tables. The default view in an table is the grid (spreadsheet) view. All other views will derive from the data entered in this view. For more on views, see the guide to views. 3.1.6 Internal Backups: Record History, Base Snapshots Airtable has system for tracking changes to a base. They provide revision history for individual records (how long those histories are stored varies by plan). Any comments made in the revision history will be stored for the life of the record (on any plan). The current state of an entire base may be captured through snapshots. Should a systemic issue arise, the base can be restored to a snapshot at a later date. Restoring from a snapshot will remove the revision history for a record but comments on that record will be maintained. As revision histories are maintained, “deleted” records may be retrieved. In the event of the need to permanently remove data, the revision history of the base may be removed. Airtable allows data to be exported as CSVs from individual tables. At this time there is not an Airtable supported base export function. 3.1.7 Importing data Data can be imported to Airtable from a number of sources including CSV files, excel, Google sheets, XML, and via copy paste. Airtable will guess what the most appropriate field type is, so make sure the field type is appropriate for the data (e.g. convert from text to date type fields). Certain sources, like Google sheets, can be imported as bases. For more on importing data see: Importing and Adding data 3.2 Base Design Having a good base design will make using your data easier. Generally, the process looks like this: Describe what the database will do and collect use cases Determine the roles of various stakeholders List out the entities in the database and define their properties Map out how the entities fit together (which properties link them) Check that the mapping meets the use cases Build base in Airtable Check that the base meets the use cases If you are migrating from spreadsheets, you likely already have an idea of what you need the base to do and a collection of data properties. It is still a good idea to follow the steps outlined above for mapping out entities. You may find that entire sheets can be replaced by views or that the data in one sheet should actually be stored in two different tables. Feel free to reach out to the data librarian for questions about base design. 3.3 Automating Airtable Airtable has five main routes for automating processes. Automations - a drag and drop visual programming tool Extensions - pre-built applications that perform some task Scripting - use JavaScript to automate tasks within Airtable Blocks - use JavaScript to create custom applications REST API - use whatever programming language you like to automate processes 3.3.1 Automations with Drag and Drop Programing (pro and above) The automations feature within Airtable allows you to visually program routines. Each automation has three basic components: Status - controls whether or not the automation will run when the trigger condition is met Triggers - condition for automation to run: the creation or change of a record, a scheduled time, or some other external action Actions - what the automation will do Automations are commonly used to augment the synced tables feature, send notifications, check data quality, and manipulate or create records. This automation creates a weekly summary of applicants who applied for a position. Its trigger is time based, then it finds records that match a condition, and finally it generates an email from those records and sends to the appropriate recipients. airtable weekly summary 3.3.2 Scripting and Blocks (pro plan and above) Scripting uses JavaScript to manipulate a base from within an application in Airtable. Scripting is flexible but has a steep learning curve. The scripting environment Airtable provides can be helpful as it provides code linting, direct access to documentation, and example scripts to build from. The major drawback to scripting is that scripts live in the base and files are not version controlled. There are a LOT of pre-written scripts, in a shared “marketplace” to perform automatic actions. Search the marketplace before you start writing bespoke code. Blocks are custom applications built in JavaScript and node.js that add to base functionality. They are created in a development environment outside of Airtable then brought back into platform. There are number of tutorials for getting started with blocks. 3.4 Using the REST API All Airtable bases are automatically accessible to authorized users via a REST API. The list of API accessible bases you have access to can be found here: https://airtable.com/api. By clicking on a base you will be able to see the full API documentation for that base. 3.4.1 Scoped Tokens Airtable is moving to a scoped tokens based approach to api access. Scoped personal access tokens allow you to create a token for a specific base with specific permissions - e.g. token has read-only access to a bat sampling base. Using scoped tokens in this way means that if the token is compromised (leaked, stolen, accidentally committed unencrypted to a github repo, etc), you can delete that token to remove any access it might have had and the limited scope means that you know exactly what a person would have been able to access. To create a personal access token go here: https://airtable.com/create/tokens ** Remember to save the token in a secure place. Do not store unencrypted tokens on the web (e.g. pushing them to github). Airtable has also deployed oauth tokens for all users. 3.4.2 Airtable and R The Airtable REST API can be used via R with the airtabler package. EHA has started a fork of the package that has additional functionality so it is recommended to use that version. The original package design works well for exploring the data. Our extension adds additional functionality to help use airtabler in automation via continuous integration such as GitHub Actions. devtools::install_github(&quot;ecohealthalliance/airtabler&quot;) The Airtable API serves up data as JSON, which has a hierarchical structure similar to a list in R. To handle JSON, airtabler uses the jsonlite package. Its helpful to understand how jsonlite handles different JSON structures when working with more complicated Airtable data. See the jsonlite quick-start guide for a basic overview. The purr package is extremely helpful when dealing with data objects derived from JSON because it facilitates navigating nested data structures. The airtabler package provides instructions for setting up access to the Airtable API. You will need to follow those instructions for the following examples to work. One to One join library(airtabler) table1 &lt;- fetch_all(base = &quot;app49bbyLczZxX9PM&quot;,table_name = &quot;One To One&quot;) table2 &lt;- fetch_all(base = &quot;app49bbyLczZxX9PM&quot;,table_name = &quot;Table 2&quot;) ## Linked records are stored as JSON arrays so they become lists ## when part of a data frame. Because each array has a length of 1 ## we can safely unlist the arrays and add them back as to the ## data frame. table1$LinkedRec &lt;- unlist(table1$LinkedRec) joinedTables &lt;- dplyr::left_join(table1,table2, by = c(&quot;LinkedRec&quot;=&quot;id&quot;)) recordKey &lt;- joinedTables[c(&quot;Name&quot;,&quot;LinkedRec&quot;,&quot;Number&quot;)] recordKey One to Many Join library(airtabler) library(dplyr) library(purrr) oneToMany &lt;- fetch_all(base = &quot;app49bbyLczZxX9PM&quot;,table_name = &quot;One To Many&quot;) table2 &lt;- fetch_all(base = &quot;app49bbyLczZxX9PM&quot;,table_name = &quot;Table 2&quot;) # Depending on how you want to work with the data joins are a # little trickier here. ## to replace the values but keep the structure oneToMany$LinkedRecReplace &lt;- purrr::map(oneToMany$LinkedRec, function(x){ table2 %&gt;% filter(id %in% x) %&gt;% select(c(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;Number&quot;)) %&gt;% pull(&quot;Number&quot;) }) data.frame( id = unlist(oneToMany$LinkedRec), label = unlist(oneToMany$LinkedRecReplace) ) 3.5 Data Management Because of its flexibility and ease of use, it is extremely important that data management for airtable be taken seriously. Unlike most other relational databases, the fundamental properties of your base can be changed easily by multiple users without warning! Documenting the structure and purpose of your base, as well as creating regular external backups could save you from catastrophe. 3.5.1 Metadata Structural metadata - Information about a resource that tells you how its put together - e.g. the relationship between a table, field, and automation. With the exception of users on the enterprise plan, you must be deliberate about creating and maintaining structural metadata for your base. Example of Airtable Structural Metadata: Descriptive metadata - Information about a resource that makes it easier to find and attribute data. This includes things attributes like author, title, description, keywords, etc. This table becomes especially important when data are transitioned out of airtable, at the end of a project, or if the base will be shared broadly with collaborators. Example of Airtable Descriptive Metadata: To see the template base, follow this link 3.5.1.1 Metadata for automations and extensions Automations and extensions live entirely inside airtable. As of August 2022, Airtable introduced a “Manage Fields” tab that provides metadata for a specific table, including any automation dependencies. It is not possible to export those dependency tables or the code used in automations automatically. This makes it extremely important to document any automations and extensions outside your base. 3.5.2 External Backups It is a good idea to create regular external backups of airtable data in the event that something catastrophic happens to your base or you simply decide you no longer wish to use airtable as your data store.Unfortunately, airtable does not provide an off the shelf solution for this. Below are three options for extracting all data from your base. 3.5.2.1 Using airtabler Using airtabler::air_dump() and airtabler::air_dump_to_csv() functions, you can export all tables to R then create a versioned folder of CSVs. See the air_dump_to_csv help page for more information. 3.5.2.2 Other Open Source Projects UnlyEd - use this template to push airtable backups to AWS S3. https://github.com/UnlyEd/airtable-backups-boilerplate 3.5.2.3 Paid services Sequin - replicate airtable to postGres database - https://www.sequin.io/sources/airtable 3.6 R R is a free and open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It was first developed in the early 1990s by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is now widely used by statisticians, data analysts, and researchers across various fields. R provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and more. It also has a large and active community of users and developers who contribute to the development of new packages and extensions for the language. R is popular in the field of data science, as it provides a powerful and flexible platform for analyzing and visualizing data. It can be used in conjuction with other tools such as Airtable through community-developed packages making it particularly well-suited for the current use-case of the RIG.

The main aim of focusing first on this limited and focused search was to get a sense of what information is available from such bodies/organisations, and the limitations of the information available. This is based on an initial idea that research funders would tend to have a system of collecting/archiving information on research they have funded. The expectation was that at the minimum, the information available from funders would lead to identifying further sources of information relevant to the ACDC database specifically those of research groups/institutions particularly those based in countries/regions within Africa. This initial search will hopefully inform a more systematic and informed search strategy for the database information. 5.1 UKRI UK Research and Innovation or UKRI is a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom that was established in 2018. It brings together the seven UK Research Councils, Innovate UK, and Research England, which were previously separate organizations, to create a single body that oversees research and innovation funding and strategy in the UK.

"],["updates.html", "Chapter 6 Updates 6.1 Wellcome Trust Grant Funding Data 6.2 ClinicalTrials.gov 6.3 Public journal/research databases 6.4 GEPRIS 6.5 EDCTP", " Chapter 6 Updates The current update process of the RIG database is summarised in this workflow: Following are the source-specific process of updating or retrieving information for the RIG database. 6.1 Wellcome Trust Grant Funding Data 6.1.1 General Information Using the downloadable spreadsheet of funds awarded between 01st of October 2005 and 4th of May 2022 found at https://cms.wellcome.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/Wellcome-grants-awarded-1-October-2005-to-04-05-2022.xlsx, the following steps were taken to retrieve relevant information for the database: 6.1.2 How to update Please note that the steps below were done using the current available spreadsheet from the Wellcome Trust website and added the relevant projects to the RIG database. These steps can therefore be used as a guide for how to update the database with new information in the future to when the Wellcome Trust publishes its most up-to-date spreadsheet. Go to column J – Recipient Org:Country -&gt; deselect all and then select all the African countries in the list Go to column N – Planned end date -&gt; select all the years in the future These two steps reduced the list from 19,833 projects to 111 projects Read the project title and decide if the project is relevant for our database or not If unsure, read the abstract – that also helps to identify the keywords to tag the project within our database If the project is relevant transfer all the information into our database Note: This method is only able to detect projects/activities where an African organisation itself holds the grant. It does not detect projects where African researchers are involved as collaborators. The spreadsheet does not list collaborators on projects, so it’s yet to be determined how we will identify projects on which African research institutes collaborate with international organisations being awarded the grant. 6.2 ClinicalTrials.gov 6.2.1 How to update Following are steps taken to extract data from ClinicalTrials.gov. Start with searching a disease/topic of interest On the results page apply the following filters to look for active studies Click on ‘Apply’ and then look manually through the column ‘Locations’ of the list of the results to find studies that take place in African countries Click on the first study to start working your way through the information available The first information provided is the sponsor -&gt; this information should be added to the Funder – column in the Activities table Information about collaborators can be added to Collaborators column Staying in the ‘Study Details’-tab, scroll down to ‘Study Design’ This section contains the official title, which should be used as the name for the Activity Additionally it contains information about the start and end date, which should be copied into the respective fields in the Activities table Scroll further down to ‘Contact and Locations’ The information given under contacts should be added to the Researcher column in Airtable Switching into the Researcher-table within in Airtable the given contact details should be added to the newly created entries for the involved researchers Also the affiliation to a certain institute can be added based on these information as well as the researcher’s location -&gt; is it possible to link the Location with the Affiliation so that the location is automatically added based on the information about the institution the researcher is affiliated with? Switch back into the Activities table and add information about the Locations to the Activity Location and the Institutions columns Scroll up again to the selection of tabs Click on the Results tab -&gt; it’s worth checking this tab even when it’s called No Results Posted as it might still contain links to publications that are affiliated with the study These links can be copied into the Published Work column in the Activities table I also copied the link of the study page on clinicaltrials.gov into the Activity Website column to determine the Research Field, I had to use my own understanding of the study so I am not sure if this can be automated or rather needs to be done by a database librarian 6.3 Public journal/research databases In order to aid in automation, maintain a list relevant search terms for each topic of interest (stored in the “Topics” table in Airtable). Even if the terms are not used for the purposes of developing a search strategy, they can be used by those who are not subject matter experts when collection information on a specific topic 6.3.1 Example of a successful search: (zoonoses OR zoonotic disease OR zoonotic illness) and (africa*) and (surveillance OR tracking OR sampling) The majority of results from this search, when conducted in PubMed, appeared relevant to the database (based on title/abstract scanning) 6.3.2 Example of PubMed search for surveillance activities for Brucellosis: (&quot;surveillance&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;prevalence&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;monitoring&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;seropositive&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;seroprevalence&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;seroevidence&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;screened&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;biosurveillance&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;sampl*&quot;[Title/Abstract]) AND (brucellosis[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;Brucella melitensis&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;B. melitensis&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;Brucella abortus&quot;[Title/Abstract] OR &quot;B. abortus&quot;[Title/Abstract]) This search yielded a large quantity of results, not all of which were relevant. Manual processes are required to validate results. Including terms to filter the results based on location were helpful, but still included results not located on the African continent. Search term to filter for African countries: (Djibouti[Title/Abstract] OR Seychelles[Title/Abstract] OR DR Congo[Title/Abstract] OR Comoros[Title/Abstract] OR Togo[Title/Abstract] OR Sierra Leone[Title/Abstract] OR Libya[Title/Abstract] OR Tanzania[Title/Abstract] OR South Africa[Title/Abstract] OR Cabo Verde[Title/Abstract] OR Congo[Title/Abstract] OR Kenya[Title/Abstract] OR Liberia[Title/Abstract] OR Central African Republic[Title/Abstract] OR Mauritania[Title/Abstract] OR Uganda[Title/Abstract] OR Algeria[Title/Abstract] OR Sudan[Title/Abstract] OR Morocco[Title/Abstract] OR Eritrea[Title/Abstract] OR Angola[Title/Abstract] OR Mozambique[Title/Abstract] OR Ghana[Title/Abstract] OR Madagascar[Title/Abstract] OR Cameroon[Title/Abstract] OR Côte d&#39;Ivoire[Title/Abstract] OR Namibia[Title/Abstract] OR Niger[Title/Abstract] OR Gambia[Title/Abstract] OR Botswana[Title/Abstract] OR Gabon[Title/Abstract] OR Sao Tome &amp; Principe[Title/Abstract] OR Lesotho[Title/Abstract] OR Burkina Faso[Title/Abstract] OR Nigeria[Title/Abstract] OR Mali[Title/Abstract] OR Guinea-Bissau[Title/Abstract] OR Malawi[Title/Abstract] OR Zambia[Title/Abstract] OR Senegal[Title/Abstract] OR Chad[Title/Abstract] OR Somalia[Title/Abstract] OR Zimbabwe[Title/Abstract] OR Equatorial Guinea[Title/Abstract] OR Guinea[Title/Abstract] OR Rwanda[Title/Abstract] OR Mauritius[Title/Abstract] OR Benin[Title/Abstract] OR Burundi[Title/Abstract] OR Tunisia[Title/Abstract] OR Eswatini[Title/Abstract] OR Ethiopia[Title/Abstract] OR South Sudan[Title/Abstract] OR Egypt[Title/Abstract]) From publications, can extract researchers, institutions, funders, activities. Ideally, researchers, institutions, and funders can be extracted automatically as opposed to manually, but scripts would need to be customized for each journal. 6.3.3 Validation of results Validation of results can be useful to better understand the overlap between publications and activities and determine the priority of searching through publications vs. navigating to institution sites directly (or other strategies). After finding a relevant publication, look at the publication’s authors and their respective institutions Navigate to institutions’ sites to search for publications or results from research Are their activities listed on the site? Are those activities explicitly mentioned in the publications? Etc. 6.3.4 Some relevant journals/databases: Zoonoses &amp; Public Health from Wiley Online Library : https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/doSearch?SeriesKey=18632378&amp;sortBy=Earliest Journal of Public Health in Africa: https://www.publichealthinafrica.org/jphia/issue/view/30 PLoS Journal of Neglected Tropical Diseases: https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/search?filterJournals=PLoSNTD 6.4 GEPRIS 6.4.1 General Information: GEPRIS is a database listing all projects funded by the German Research Foundation (German: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; abbr. DFG) The DFG is a research funding organisation, which functions as a self-governing institution for the promotion of science and research in the Federal Republic Germany. In 2019, the DFG had a funding budget of €3.3 billion. 6.4.2 How to Use: The database can be accessed here: https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/OCTOPUS?language=en&amp;task=showSearchSimple This link should directly lead to the English version of the website, otherwise the language can be changed by clicking on English in the top right corner. In the database one can search for Projects, People, or Institutions – for our purpose the project option is the most relevant One can either search for keywords or filter for different criteria – for a systematic approach I found using the filtering options easier than going through all our On the search start site stay in the Projects tab. Click on Show extended search. Under Subject Area select one of the following: Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine Basic Research in Biology and Medicine Medicine Microbiology, Virology, and Immunology Social Sciences Water Research Zoology Note: After working through all these subject areas, any relevant project in the field of One Health should be picked up by the searches Leave everything under DFG Programme as it is Move on to Funding and change Status to Current Move on to International and change Continent to Africa Click on Find Read through the project titles on the results page to identify relevant projects Import all the relevant project information (as highlighted on the screenshots) into the Africa CDC database To identify the research institutes that are involved in the project one has to click on the researchers names and extract that information from their profile (their affiliation with a research institute is listed there) 6.4.3 Positive aspects of this source: The filtering options allow to filter for several criteria which are crucial for the relevance of a project to our database. That removes a lot of irrelevant projects from the results pages. The project pages list almost all the information we are interested in. 6.4.4 Downsides of this source: The project page doesn’t list the anticipated end date of a project. One has to click on the link to the researcher’s profile to identify the participating organisations. Even using all the different filtering options not all resulting hits are relevant for our database, so I don’t think the process can be fully automated or at least requires a subsequent manual validation or clean up step to remove irrelevant projects. 6.5 EDCTP 6.5.1 General Information The European &amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) is a non-profit organisation with a European office in The Hague, The Netherlands and an African office in Cape Town, South Africa. EDCTP is a partnership between European Union (EU), Norway, Switzerland, and African countries to accelerate the development of new clinical interventions such as drugs, vaccines, microbicides, and diagnostics against poverty-related diseases in Africa. The organisation supports clinical trials, capacity strengthening and networking in Africa and Europe. Funding comes from the EU, member states, pharmaceutical industry and private organisations and charities like The Wellcome Trust and The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation. Note: Since funding comes from several sources that we also list as sources for populating the database such as the European Union (European Commission), The Wellcome Trust and The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, there is the possibility that downloading project information from all these sources into our database could lead to duplicate entries. I created a column in the Actvities table for the Project ID, as this might be helpful to identify duplicates and remove them automatically. 6.5.2 How to use: The database of funded project can be accessed here: https://www.edctp.org/edctp2-project-portal/ There is the option to download the list of projects as a PDF, CSV or XLXS file. Personally, I did not find that helpful for manually adding projects to the database, but it might be useful for an automated process. Go to Status of Project and select the filter Active Go to Classification and select one of the following filters: Co-Infections COVID-19 Cysticercosis/Taeniasis Diagnostics Diarrhoeal Diseases Drugs Emerging Infections, incl. Ebola, Lassa Epidemiology HIV Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) Implementation Research Leishmaniases Leprosy (Hansen disease) Lower respiratory infections Lymphatic filariasis Malaria Microbicides Onchocerciasis (river blindness) Rabies Schistosomiasis Soil-transmitted helminthiasis Social Science Tuberculosis Vaccines Yaws Yellow Fever Note: Only one Classification at a time can be selected Once one Classification was selected click on search Change from Show Map to Show List -&gt; this makes it easier to systematically look through the projects On the results list you can see the location of the coordinating organisation, but even if it is not in an African country, it is worth checking the project details for the Participating Organisations. So read the project title and decide whether this could be a relevant project, if so, click on View details Check the Participating Organisations first to decide whether the project is relevant to our database: If the project is relevant use the Project Name + Acronym for the Activity Column Transfer all the relevant information to our database, including Project ID, Start and End date, Participating Organisations and corresponding locations, Project Website, Coordinating Organisation and Coordinating Researcher Tag the project with the correct keywords in the Activity Type, Activity Outputs, Target Species, Topic, and Research Field columns based on your understanding of the project abstract 6.5.3 Benefits of this Source: The projects can be easily filtered for currently active projects. The EDCTP is specifically focused on projects in Africa or Europe with African collaborators so most projects fulfil at least one of our selection criteria A lot of the projects (not all) are also topic-wise relevant for our database The database lists most of the information that we are interested in for our database 6.5.4 Shortcomings of this source: Only one disease/topic can be selected at a time so sequential searches are necessary Project details only list the Coordinating researcher but no other lead researchers at the participating organisations "],["survey.html", "Chapter 7 Survey", " Chapter 7 Survey "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
