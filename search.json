The database contains information about scientific research being conducted on the African continent that has particular relevance to understanding, detecting and responding to zoonotic pathogens. EHA is building a detailed, searchable, and visual database (e.g.¬†via a dashboard) populated with information about major (e.g.¬†multi-year) and active One Health research projects that includes subject matter, duration, geographical locations, key personnel, and links to publicly available reports, preprints and publications relevant to zoonoses. Examples of research areas may include epidemiological (syndrome based or disease specific), ecological (studies looking at potential reservoirs or animal hosts for zoonotic pathogens and spillover into humans or livestock); basic science (e.g.¬†virology, bacteriology; serology); clinical (vaccine or therapeutic trials); or sociological (e.g.¬†behavioral risk assessments or behavioral intervention studies) or any other preliminary public health findings. A particularly important view within the database includes a directory of subject matter experts associated with research across the continent. This roster view can be used by public health practitioners to engage expert consultations as needed to support training activities, surveillance or outbreak response, for example.",

    "text": "5.2 Security and Access Control\nAirtable maintains physical and technological security as part of its ISO IEC 27001:2013 and SOC 2 compliance measures. Data are 256-bit encrypted when storing on the server and also when transferring data over the internet. To find vulnerabilities in their software, they run daily, weekly, and monthly scans on different components of their system and regularly commission external penetration tests. They also run a bug bounty program to help identify issues. Their data centers have fire detection and suppression systems, redundant power systems, and strict control for physical access. Because Airtable relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for its cloud infrastructure (the same providers used by previous EHA projects), data are geo-redundantly replicated in backups across multiple zones to increase data durability. They also have a team monitoring services at all times. Airtable employees are thoroughly vetted before hiring and continually trained on data protection best practices. Their workstations are secured by using full-disk encryption, automatic locking, and strong password requirements.\n\n5.2.1 User and Administrator Security Features\n\n5.2.1.1 Access Controls\nAirtable provides database (referred to as ‚Äúbase‚Äù) and workspace administrators with granular controls over who can view, edit, comment, or otherwise modify data at the base, table, and field levels. There are four levels of Airtable user permissions:\n\nOwner/Creator: Full administrative control of base\n\nEditor: Sees full base, create and modify records and views, create and modify view share links\n\nCommenter: Sees full base, comment on records\n\nReader: Sees full base\n\nDirect access to a base or workspace is granted or removed by base owners and creators to Airtable users. Base owners and creators can control who has access to a base and can control any ‚Äúshare‚Äù links created for that base. They may also restrict editing of tables or fields within a base. Any collaborator given direct access to a base at any permission level will be able to duplicate that base and share that data further. It is important that direct access to the base is limited to individuals with a need to curate or analyze the data.\n\n\n5.2.1.2 Share Links and Interfaces\nTo further restrict access to a base, users can be given indirect access via revocable share links or interfaces.\nShare links can be customized to prevent users from seeing the full base, prevent duplicating the base, and prevent copying data from the base. The ability to use the link can be password protected, restricted to people with certain email domains, and may be revoked at any time. If there are concerns about data leaks via base or table duplication, inviting people with a need to view the data via share links constrains their ability to extract data from the base.\nInterfaces are dynamic dashboards built on a limited set of data in an airtable base. Users can explore or even edit data based on the permissions provided by the interface creator. Access can be further tuned by setting up a ‚Äúcurrent-user filter‚Äù.

Information in this section pertains to all plans unless specified.\n\n5.3.1 Workspaces, Bases, Tables, Fields, Records\nAirtable uses workspaces, bases, tables, and fields to manage data. A workspace generally pertains to a particular project and contains all bases relevant to that project. Sharing a workspace with someone allows them to see all bases within that workspace.\nBases are equivalent to databases. They consist of a set of tables that can be linked and allow you to perform some task (e.g.¬†IRB tracking, capturing research data, etc.). Bases can be duplicated and shared across your workspaces and you can share bases with other users.\nTables are where most of the action happens. Data is entered in tables, tables can be transformed via views into calendars, dashboards, or galleries, and tables can be manipulated via the API. They describe a data entity and are composed of fields. In the bat sampling example, each circle would be a table in the bat sampling base (see Figure¬†5.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbat_sampling\n\n\n\na\n\nCollector\n\n\n\nc\n\nBat\n\n\n\na-&gt;c\n\nCollected by\n\n\n\nb\n\nSite\n\n\n\nb-&gt;c\n\nCollected at\n\n\n\nf\n\nPhysical\nsample\n\n\n\nc-&gt;f\n\nCollected from\n\n\n\nd\n\nAntibody\ntest result\n\n\n\ne\n\nPCR\ntest result\n\n\n\nf-&gt;d\n\nDerived from\n\n\n\nf-&gt;e\n\nDerived from\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.1: Data model for bat sampling example\n\n\n\n\n\nFields represent properties of a data entity.

Fields can be linked between tables creating links.\nRecords are the individual data points in a table. In a spreadsheet they would be the rows.

Each automation has three basic components (see Figure¬†5.2):\n\nStatus - controls whether or not the automation will run when the trigger condition is met\nTriggers - condition for automation to run: the creation or change of a record, a scheduled time, or some other external action\nActions - what the automation will do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.2: Actions diagram\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomations are commonly used to augment the synced tables feature, send notifications, check data quality, and manipulate or create records.\nThis automation (see Figure¬†5.3) creates a weekly summary of applicants who applied for a position. Its trigger is time based, then it finds records that match a condition, and finally it generates an email from those records and sends to the appropriate recipients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5.3: Airtable weekly summary\n\n\n\n\n\n5.8.2 Scripting and Blocks (pro plan and above)\nScripting uses JavaScript to manipulate a base from within an application in Airtable. Scripting is flexible but has a steep learning curve. The scripting environment Airtable provides can be helpful as it provides code linting, direct access to documentation, and example scripts to build from. The major drawback to scripting is that scripts live in the base and files are not version controlled.\n\nThere are a LOT of pre-written scripts, in a shared ‚Äúmarketplace‚Äù to perform automatic actions. Search the marketplace before you start writing bespoke code.\n\nBlocks are custom applications built in JavaScript and node.js that add to base functionality. They are created in a development environment outside of Airtable then brought back into platform. There are number of tutorials for getting started with blocks.",

The list of API accessible bases you have access to can be found here: https://airtable.com/api. By clicking on a base you will be able to see the full API documentation for that base.\n\n5.9.1 Scoped Tokens\nAirtable is moving to a scoped tokens based approach to api access. Scoped personal access tokens allow you to create a token for a specific base with specific permissions - e.g.¬†token has read-only access to a bat sampling base. Using scoped tokens in this way means that if the token is compromised (leaked, stolen, accidentally committed unencrypted to a github repo, etc), you can delete that token to remove any access it might have had and the limited scope means that you know exactly what a person would have been able to access.\nTo create a personal access token go here: https://airtable.com/create/tokens\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember to save the token in a secure place. Do not store unencrypted tokens on the web (e.g.¬†pushing them to GitHub).\n\n\nAirtable has also deployed OAuth tokens for all users.\n\n\n5.9.2 Airtable and R\nThe Airtable REST API can be used via R with the airtabler package. EHA has started a fork of the package that has additional functionality so it is recommended to use that version. The original package design works well for exploring the data. Our extension adds additional functionality to help use airtabler in automation via continuous integration such as GitHub Actions.\ndevtools::install_github(\"ecohealthalliance/airtabler\")\nThe Airtable API serves up data as JSON, which has a hierarchical structure similar to a list in R. To handle JSON, airtabler uses the jsonlite package. Its helpful to understand how jsonlite handles different JSON structures when working with more complicated Airtable data. See the jsonlite quick-start guide for a basic overview. The purrr package is extremely helpful when dealing with data objects derived from JSON because it facilitates navigating nested data structures.\nThe airtabler package provides instructions for setting up access to the Airtable API. You will need to follow those instructions for Example¬†5.1 and Example¬†5.2 to work.\n\nExample 5.1 ¬†\nlibrary(airtabler)\n\ntable1  &lt;-  fetch_all(base = \"app49bbyLczZxX9PM\",table_name = \"One To One\")\n\ntable2 &lt;- fetch_all(base = \"app49bbyLczZxX9PM\",table_name = \"Table 2\")\n\n## Linked records are stored as JSON arrays so they become lists \n## when part of a data frame. Because each array has a length of 1\n## we can safely unlist the arrays and add them back as to the \n## data frame.\n\ntable1$LinkedRec &lt;- unlist(table1$LinkedRec)\n\njoinedTables &lt;- dplyr::left_join(table1,table2, by = c(\"LinkedRec\"=\"id\"))\n\nrecordKey &lt;- joinedTables[c(\"Name\",\"LinkedRec\",\"Number\")]\n\nrecordKey\nOne to One join\n\n\nExample 5.2 ¬†\nlibrary(airtabler)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\noneToMany &lt;- fetch_all(base = \"app49bbyLczZxX9PM\", table_name = \"One To Many\")\n\ntable2 &lt;- fetch_all(base = \"app49bbyLczZxX9PM\",table_name = \"Table 2\")\n\n# Depending on how you want to work with the data joins are a \n# little trickier here. \n\n## to replace the values but keep the structure\n\noneToMany$LinkedRecReplace &lt;- purrr::map(oneToMany$LinkedRec, function(x){\n  table2 %&gt;%\n    filter(id %in% x) %&gt;%\n    select(c(\"id\",\"Number\")) %&gt;% \n    pull(\"Number\")\n})\n\ndata.frame(\n  id = unlist(oneToMany$LinkedRec), \n  label = unlist(oneToMany$LinkedRecReplace)\n)\nOne to Many Join",

    "text": "5.10 Data Management\nBecause of its flexibility and ease of use, it is extremely important that data management for airtable be taken seriously. Unlike most other relational databases, the fundamental properties of your base can be changed easily by multiple users without warning! Documenting the structure and purpose of your base, as well as creating regular external backups could save you from catastrophe.\n\n5.10.1 Metadata\n\nStructural metadata - Information about a resource that tells you how its put together - e.g.¬†the relationship between a table, field, and automation. With the exception of users on the enterprise plan, you must be deliberate about creating and maintaining structural metadata for your base.\n\nExample of Airtable Structural Metadata:\n\n\n\nDescriptive metadata - Information about a resource that makes it easier to find and attribute data. This includes things attributes like author, title, description, keywords, etc. This table becomes especially important when data are transitioned out of airtable, at the end of a project, or if the base will be shared broadly with collaborators.\n\nExample of Airtable Descriptive Metadata:\n\n\nTo see the template base, follow this link\n\n5.10.1.1 Metadata for automations and extensions\nAutomations and extensions live entirely inside airtable. As of August 2022, Airtable introduced a ‚ÄúManage Fields‚Äù tab that provides metadata for a specific table, including any automation dependencies. It is not possible to export those dependency tables or the code used in automations automatically. This makes it extremely important to document any automations and extensions outside your base.\n\n\n\n5.10.2 External Backups\nIt is a good idea to create regular external backups of airtable data in the event that something catastrophic happens to your base or you simply decide you no longer wish to use airtable as your data store.Unfortunately, airtable does not provide an off the shelf solution for this. Below are three options for extracting all data from your base.\n\n5.10.2.1 Using airtabler\nUsing airtabler::air_dump() and airtabler::air_dump_to_csv() functions, you can export all tables to R then create a versioned folder of CSVs. See the air_dump_to_csv help page for more information.\n\n\n5.10.2.2 Other Open Source Projects\nUnlyEd - use this template to push airtable backups to AWS S3.\n\nhttps://github.com/UnlyEd/airtable-backups-boilerplate\n\n\n\n5.10.2.3 Paid services\nSequin - replicate airtable to postGres database (https://www.sequin.io/sources/airtable)",

The main aim of focusing first on this limited and focused search was to get a sense of what information is available from such bodies/organisations, and the limitations of the information available. This is based on an initial idea that research funders would tend to have a system of collecting/archiving information on research they have funded. The expectation was that at the minimum, the information available from funders would lead to identifying further sources of information relevant to the ACDC database specifically those of research groups/institutions particularly those based in countries/regions within Africa. This initial search will hopefully inform a more systematic and informed search strategy for the database information.\nUK Research and Innovation or UKRI is a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom that was established in 2018. It brings together the seven UK Research Councils, Innovate UK, and Research England, which were previously separate organizations, to create a single body that oversees research and innovation funding and strategy in the UK.\nThe seven UK Research Councils are:\nInnovate UK is the UK‚Äôs innovation agency, which provides funding and support for innovative businesses and projects.\nResearch England is responsible for funding and overseeing research in English universities and higher education institutions.\nUKRI‚Äôs main role is to drive innovation and research in the UK and to support research and development that benefits society and the economy. It funds research projects, provides support to researchers, promotes international collaboration, and works to ensure that research and innovation are integrated with government policies and priorities.\nOf these various groups within UKRI, we further focused on the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), Medical Research Council (MRC), Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Innovate UK, and Research England.",

    "text": "9.4 GEPRIS\n\n9.4.1 General Information:\nGEPRIS is a database listing all projects funded by the German Research Foundation (German: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; abbr. DFG) The DFG is a research funding organisation, which functions as a self-governing institution for the promotion of science and research in the Federal Republic Germany. In 2019, the DFG had a funding budget of ‚Ç¨3.3 billion.\n\n\n9.4.2 How to Use:\nThe database can be accessed here: https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/OCTOPUS?language=en&task=showSearchSimple\nThis link should directly lead to the English version of the website, otherwise the language can be changed by clicking on English in the top right corner.\n\nIn the database one can search for Projects, People, or Institutions ‚Äì for our purpose the project option is the most relevant\nOne can either search for keywords or filter for different criteria ‚Äì for a systematic approach I found using the filtering options easier than going through all our\n\n\nOn the search start site stay in the Projects tab.\nClick on Show extended search.\nUnder Subject Area select one of the following:\n\nAgriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine\nBasic Research in Biology and Medicine\nMedicine\nMicrobiology, Virology, and Immunology\nSocial Sciences\nWater Research\nZoology\n\n\nNote: After working through all these subject areas, any relevant project in the field of One Health should be picked up by the searches\n\nLeave everything under DFG Programme as it is\nMove on to Funding and change Status to Current\nMove on to International and change Continent to Africa\nClick on Find\nRead through the project titles on the results page to identify relevant projects\nImport all the relevant project information (as highlighted on the screenshots) into the Africa CDC database\n\n \n\nTo identify the research institutes that are involved in the project one has to click on the researchers names and extract that information from their profile (their affiliation with a research institute is listed there)\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Positive aspects of this source:\nThe filtering options allow to filter for several criteria which are crucial for the relevance of a project to our database. That removes a lot of irrelevant projects from the results pages. The project pages list almost all the information we are interested in.\n\n\n9.4.4 Downsides of this source:\nThe project page doesn‚Äôt list the anticipated end date of a project.\nOne has to click on the link to the researcher‚Äôs profile to identify the participating organisations.\nEven using all the different filtering options not all resulting hits are relevant for our database, so I don‚Äôt think the process can be fully automated or at least requires a subsequent manual validation or clean up step to remove irrelevant projects.",

    "text": "9.5 EDCTP\n\n9.5.1 General Information\nThe European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) is a non-profit organisation with a European office in The Hague, The Netherlands and an African office in Cape Town, South Africa. EDCTP is a partnership between European Union (EU), Norway, Switzerland, and African countries to accelerate the development of new clinical interventions such as drugs, vaccines, microbicides, and diagnostics against poverty-related diseases in Africa. The organisation supports clinical trials, capacity strengthening and networking in Africa and Europe. Funding comes from the EU, member states, pharmaceutical industry and private organisations and charities like The Wellcome Trust and The Bill & Melinda Gates foundation.\nNote: Since funding comes from several sources that we also list as sources for populating the database such as the European Union (European Commission), The Wellcome Trust and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, there is the possibility that downloading project information from all these sources into our database could lead to duplicate entries. I created a column in the Actvities table for the Project ID, as this might be helpful to identify duplicates and remove them automatically.\n\n\n9.5.2 How to use:\nThe database of funded project can be accessed here: https://www.edctp.org/edctp2-project-portal/\nThere is the option to download the list of projects as a PDF, CSV or XLXS file. Personally, I did not find that helpful for manually adding projects to the database, but it might be useful for an automated process.\n\nGo to Status of Project and select the filter Active\nGo to Classification and select one of the following filters:\n\nCo-Infections\nCOVID-19\nCysticercosis/Taeniasis\n\nDiagnostics\nDiarrhoeal Diseases\nDrugs\nEmerging Infections, incl.¬†Ebola, Lassa\nEpidemiology\nHIV\nHuman African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)\n\nImplementation Research\n\nLeishmaniases\nLeprosy (Hansen disease)\nLower respiratory infections\n\nLymphatic filariasis\nMalaria\nMicrobicides\nOnchocerciasis (river blindness)\nRabies\nSchistosomiasis\nSoil-transmitted helminthiasis\n\nSocial Science\nTuberculosis\nVaccines\nYaws\nYellow Fever\n\n\nNote: Only one Classification at a time can be selected\n\nOnce one Classification was selected click on search\nChange from Show Map to Show List -&gt; this makes it easier to systematically look through the projects\nOn the results list you can see the location of the coordinating organisation, but even if it is not in an African country, it is worth checking the project details for the Participating Organisations. So read the project title and decide whether this could be a relevant project, if so, click on View details\n\n\n\nCheck the Participating Organisations first to decide whether the project is relevant to our database:\n\n\n\nIf the project is relevant use the Project Name + Acronym for the Activity Column\nTransfer all the relevant information to our database, including Project ID, Start and End date, Participating Organisations and corresponding locations, Project Website, Coordinating Organisation and Coordinating Researcher\nTag the project with the correct keywords in the Activity Type, Activity Outputs, Target Species, Topic, and Research Field columns based on your understanding of the project abstract\n\n\n\n9.5.3 Benefits of this Source:\nThe projects can be easily filtered for currently active projects.\nThe EDCTP is specifically focused on projects in Africa or Europe with African collaborators so most projects fulfil at least one of our selection criteria\nA lot of the projects (not all) are also topic-wise relevant for our database\nThe database lists most of the information that we are interested in for our database\n\n\n9.5.4 Shortcomings of this source:\nOnly one disease/topic can be selected at a time so sequential searches are necessary\nProject details only list the Coordinating researcher but no other lead researchers at the participating organisations",
