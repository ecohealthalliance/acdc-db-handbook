The organisation supports clinical trials, capacity strengthening and networking in Africa and Europe. Funding comes from the EU, member states, pharmaceutical industry and private organisations and charities like The Wellcome Trust and The Bill & Melinda Gates foundation.\nNote: Since funding comes from several sources that we also list as sources for populating the database such as the European Union (European Commission), The Wellcome Trust and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, there is the possibility that downloading project information from all these sources into our database could lead to duplicate entries.

Personally, I did not find that helpful for manually adding projects to the database, but it might be useful for an automated process.\n\nGo to Status of Project and select the filter Active\nGo to Classification and select one of the following filters:\n\nCo-Infections\nCOVID-19\nCysticercosis/Taeniasis\n\nDiagnostics\nDiarrhoeal Diseases\nDrugs\nEmerging Infections, incl.¬†Ebola, Lassa\nEpidemiology\nHIV\nHuman African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)\n\nImplementation Research\n\nLeishmaniases\nLeprosy (Hansen disease)\nLower respiratory infections\n\nLymphatic filariasis\nMalaria\nMicrobicides\nOnchocerciasis (river blindness)\nRabies\nSchistosomiasis\nSoil-transmitted helminthiasis\n\nSocial Science\nTuberculosis\nVaccines\nYaws\nYellow Fever\n\n\nNote: Only one Classification at a time can be selected\n\nOnce one Classification was selected click on search\nChange from Show Map to Show List -&gt; this makes it easier to systematically look through the projects\nOn the results list you can see the location of the coordinating organisation, but even if it is not in an African country, it is worth checking the project details for the Participating Organisations. So read the project title and decide whether this could be a relevant project, if so, click on View details\n\n\n\nCheck the Participating Organisations first to decide whether the project is relevant to our database:\n\n\n\nIf the project is relevant use the Project Name + Acronym for the Activity Column\nTransfer all the relevant information to our database, including Project ID, Start and End date, Participating Organisations and corresponding locations, Project Website, Coordinating Organisation and Coordinating Researcher\nTag the project with the correct keywords in the Activity Type, Activity Outputs, Target Species, Topic, and Research Field columns based on your understanding of the project abstract\n\n\n\n6.5.3 Benefits of this Source:\nThe projects can be easily filtered for currently active projects.\nThe EDCTP is specifically focused on projects in Africa or Europe with African collaborators so most projects fulfil at least one of our selection criteria\nA lot of the projects (not all) are also topic-wise relevant for our database\nThe database lists most of the information that we are interested in for our database\n\n\n6.5.4 Shortcomings of this source:\nOnly one disease/topic can be selected at a time so sequential searches are necessary\nProject details only list the Coordinating researcher but no other lead researchers at the participating organisations",

In 2019, the DFG had a funding budget of ‚Ç¨3.3 billion.\n\n\n10.4.2 How to Use:\nThe database can be accessed here: https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/OCTOPUS?language=en&task=showSearchSimple\nThis link should directly lead to the English version of the website, otherwise the language can be changed by clicking on English in the top right corner.\n\nIn the database one can search for Projects, People, or Institutions ‚Äì for our purpose the project option is the most relevant\nOne can either search for keywords or filter for different criteria ‚Äì for a systematic approach I found using the filtering options easier than going through all our\n\n\nOn the search start site stay in the Projects tab.\nClick on Show extended search.\nUnder Subject Area select one of the following:\n\nAgriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine\nBasic Research in Biology and Medicine\nMedicine\nMicrobiology, Virology, and Immunology\nSocial Sciences\nWater Research\nZoology\n\n\nNote: After working through all these subject areas, any relevant project in the field of One Health should be picked up by the searches\n\nLeave everything under DFG Programme as it is\nMove on to Funding and change Status to Current\nMove on to International and change Continent to Africa\nClick on Find\nRead through the project titles on the results page to identify relevant projects\nImport all the relevant project information (as highlighted on the screenshots) into the Africa CDC database\n\n \n\nTo identify the research institutes that are involved in the project one has to click on the researchers names and extract that information from their profile (their affiliation with a research institute is listed there)\n\n\n\n10.4.3 Positive aspects of this source:\nThe filtering options allow to filter for several criteria which are crucial for the relevance of a project to our database. That removes a lot of irrelevant projects from the results pages. The project pages list almost all the information we are interested in.\n\n\n10.4.4 Downsides of this source:\nThe project page doesn‚Äôt list the anticipated end date of a project.\nOne has to click on the link to the researcher‚Äôs profile to identify the participating organisations.\nEven using all the different filtering options not all resulting hits are relevant for our database, so I don‚Äôt think the process can be fully automated or at least requires a subsequent manual validation or clean up step to remove irrelevant projects.",

    "text": "10.5 EDCTP\n\n10.5.1 General Information\nThe European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) is a non-profit organisation with a European office in The Hague, The Netherlands and an African office in Cape Town, South Africa. EDCTP is a partnership between European Union (EU), Norway, Switzerland, and African countries to accelerate the development of new clinical interventions such as drugs, vaccines, microbicides, and diagnostics against poverty-related diseases in Africa. The organisation supports clinical trials, capacity strengthening and networking in Africa and Europe. Funding comes from the EU, member states, pharmaceutical industry and private organisations and charities like The Wellcome Trust and The Bill & Melinda Gates foundation.\nNote: Since funding comes from several sources that we also list as sources for populating the database such as the European Union (European Commission), The Wellcome Trust and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, there is the possibility that downloading project information from all these sources into our database could lead to duplicate entries. I created a column in the Actvities table for the Project ID, as this might be helpful to identify duplicates and remove them automatically.\n\n\n10.5.2 How to use:\nThe database of funded project can be accessed here: https://www.edctp.org/edctp2-project-portal/\nThere is the option to download the list of projects as a PDF, CSV or XLXS file. Personally, I did not find that helpful for manually adding projects to the database, but it might be useful for an automated process.\n\nGo to Status of Project and select the filter Active\nGo to Classification and select one of the following filters:\n\nCo-Infections\nCOVID-19\nCysticercosis/Taeniasis\n\nDiagnostics\nDiarrhoeal Diseases\nDrugs\nEmerging Infections, incl.¬†Ebola, Lassa\nEpidemiology\nHIV\nHuman African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)\n\nImplementation Research\n\nLeishmaniases\nLeprosy (Hansen disease)\nLower respiratory infections\n\nLymphatic filariasis\nMalaria\nMicrobicides\nOnchocerciasis (river blindness)\nRabies\nSchistosomiasis\nSoil-transmitted helminthiasis\n\nSocial Science\nTuberculosis\nVaccines\nYaws\nYellow Fever\n\n\nNote: Only one Classification at a time can be selected\n\nOnce one Classification was selected click on search\nChange from Show Map to Show List -&gt; this makes it easier to systematically look through the projects\nOn the results list you can see the location of the coordinating organisation, but even if it is not in an African country, it is worth checking the project details for the Participating Organisations. So read the project title and decide whether this could be a relevant project, if so, click on View details\n\n\n\nCheck the Participating Organisations first to decide whether the project is relevant to our database:\n\n\n\nIf the project is relevant use the Project Name + Acronym for the Activity Column\nTransfer all the relevant information to our database, including Project ID, Start and End date, Participating Organisations and corresponding locations, Project Website, Coordinating Organisation and Coordinating Researcher\nTag the project with the correct keywords in the Activity Type, Activity Outputs, Target Species, Topic, and Research Field columns based on your understanding of the project abstract\n\n\n\n10.5.3 Benefits of this Source:\nThe projects can be easily filtered for currently active projects.\nThe EDCTP is specifically focused on projects in Africa or Europe with African collaborators so most projects fulfil at least one of our selection criteria\nA lot of the projects (not all) are also topic-wise relevant for our database\nThe database lists most of the information that we are interested in for our database\n\n\n10.5.4 Shortcomings of this source:\nOnly one disease/topic can be selected at a time so sequential searches are necessary\nProject details only list the Coordinating researcher but no other lead researchers at the participating organisations",
